            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of machines to perform tasks that are typically
                 associated with human intelligence, such as learning and problem-solving. AI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., 
                 Google Search), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), 
                 self-driving cars 
                (e.g., Waymo), generative or creative tools (ChatGPT and AI art), and competing at the highest level in strategic games 
                (such as chess and Go)
                Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956. The field went through multiple cycles of optimism 
                followed by disappointment and loss of funding,but after 2012, when deep learning surpassed all previous AI techniques
                ,there was a vast increase in funding and interest.
                The various sub-fields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of
                 AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for 
                 robotics. General intelligence (the ability to solve an arbitrary problem) is among the field's long-term goals. To solve these
                  problems, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of problem-solving techniques, including search and mathematical 
                  optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics,
                 probability, and economics. AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience and many other fields.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">GoalsThe general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken 
                down into sub-problems. These consist of 
                particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. 
                The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research.
                Reasoning, problem-solving
                Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve 
                puzzles or make logical deductions.[10] By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or
                 incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics.
                
                Many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a 
                "combinatorial explosion": they became exponentially slower as the problems grew larger. Even humans rarely use the 
                step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments.
                 Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem.</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Planning</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Planning and decision making
                An "agent" is anything that takes actions in the world. A rational agent has goals or preferences and takes
                 actions to make them happen.[d][30] In automated planning, the agent has a specific goal.[31] In automated decision making,
                  the agent has preferences – there are some situations it would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid. 
                  The decision making agent assigns a number to each situation (called the "utility") that measures how much the agent prefers it. 
                  For each possible action, it can calculate the "expected utility": the utility of all possible outcomes of the action, weighted
                   by the probability that the outcome will occur. It can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility.[32]
                

                In classical planning, the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be.In most real-world problems,
                 however, the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in (it is "unknown" or "unobservable") and it may not 
                 know for certain what will happen after each possible action (it is not "deterministic"). It must choose an action by making a
                  probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked. In some problems, the agent's preferences 
                  may be uncertain, especially if there are other agents or humans involved. These can be learned (e.g., with inverse reinforcement 
                  learning) or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences.Information value theory can be used to weigh the value 
                  of exploratory or experimental actions. The space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large, so
                   the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain what the final outcome will be.
                
                A Markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will 
                change the state in a particular way, and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action.
                 A policy associates a decision with each possible state. The policy could be calculated (e.g. by iteration), be heuristic, 
                 or it can be learned.
                
                Game theory describes rational behavior of multiple interacting agents, and is used in AI programs that make decisions that
                 involve other agents.
